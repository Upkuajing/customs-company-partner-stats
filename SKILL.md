# Customs Company Trade Partner Trends

Query company trade partner trends from customs data using the UpKuaJing Open Platform API.

## Overview

This skill provides access to company trade partner trends from UpKuaJing's customs database. Given a company ID, company type, and optional filters (date range, products, HS codes, countries, partners, port), it returns comprehensive partner distribution data including total amount/quantity/weight, monthly trade dates, HS code distribution, and product distribution.

## Running Scripts

### Environment Setup

1. **Check Python**: `python --version`
2. **Install dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Script directory: `scripts/*.py`
Run example: `python scripts/*.py`

**Important**: Always use direct script invocation like `python scripts/customs_company_partner_stats.py`. **Do NOT use** shell compound commands like `cd scripts && python customs_company_partner_stats.py`

### Company Trade Partner Trends Query (`customs_company_partner_stats.py`)
- **Return granularity**: One comprehensive record per company with multi-dimensional distribution data
- **Use cases**: View a company's partner composition, analyze HS code and product distribution
- **Examples**:
  - "Get trade partner trends for company 100001 as a supplier"
  - "Query partner distribution for company 100001 as a buyer with filters"
- **Parameters**: See [Company Trade Partner Trends API](references/customs-company-partner-stats-api.md)

## API Key and Top-up

This skill requires an API key. The API key is stored in the `~/.upkuajing/.env` file:
```bash
cat ~/.upkuajing/.env
```
**Example file content**:
```
UPKUAJING_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
### **API Key Not Set**
First check if the `~/.upkuajing/.env` file has UPKUAJING_API_KEY;
If UPKUAJING_API_KEY is not set, prompt the user to choose:
1. User has one: User provides it (manually add to ~/.upkuajing/.env file)
2. User doesn't have one: You can apply using the interface (`auth.py --new_key`), the new key will be automatically saved to ~/.upkuajing/.env
Wait for user selection;

### **Account Top-up**
When API response indicates insufficient balance, explain and guide user to top up:
1. Create top-up order (`auth.py --new_rec_order`)
2. Based on order response, send payment page URL to user, guide user to open URL and pay, user confirms after successful payment;

### **Get Account Information**
Use this script to get account information for UPKUAJING_API_KEY: `auth.py --account_info`

## API Key and UpKuaJing Account
- Newly applied API key: Register and login at [UpKuaJing Open Platform](https://developer.upkuajing.com/), then bind account

## Fees

**All API calls incur fees**, different interfaces have different billing methods.

**Latest pricing**: Users can visit [Detailed Price Description](https://www.upkuajing.com/web/openapi/price.html)
Or use: `python scripts/auth.py --price_info` (returns complete pricing for all interfaces)

### Query Billing Rules

Billed by **number of calls**, each call returns partner trends for one company:
- Each API call incurs a fee
- **Before execution:**
  1. Inform user that this query will incur a fee
  2. Stop, wait for explicit user confirmation in a separate message, then execute script

### Fee Confirmation Principle

**Any operation that incurs fees must first inform and wait for explicit user confirmation. Do not execute in the same message as the notification.**

## Workflow

### Decision Guide

| User Intent | Use API |
|-------------|---------|
| "Get trade partner trends for company 100001 as a supplier" | Company Trade Partner Trends Query |
| "Analyze HS code distribution for company 100001" | Company Trade Partner Trends Query |

## Usage Examples

### Query Company Trade Partner Trends

**User request**: "Get trade partner trends for company 100001 as a supplier"
```bash
python scripts/customs_company_partner_stats.py --params '{"companyId":100001,"companyType":1}'
```

**Query with date range and filters**:
```bash
python scripts/customs_company_partner_stats.py --params '{"companyId":100001,"companyType":1,"dateStart":1700000000000,"dateEnd":1735689599999,"hscodes":["847130"],"countryCodes":["US"]}'
```

## Error Handling

- **API key invalid/non-existent**: Check `UPKUAJING_API_KEY` in `~/.upkuajing/.env` file
- **Insufficient balance**: Guide user to top up
- **Invalid parameters**: **Must first check the corresponding API documentation in references/ directory**, get correct parameter names and formats from documentation, do not guess

### API Documentation Reference

- Company Trade Partner Trends: Check [references/customs-company-partner-stats-api.md](references/customs-company-partner-stats-api.md)

## Best Practices

1. **Check API documentation**:
   - **Before executing queries, must first check the corresponding API reference documentation**
   - Check [references/customs-company-partner-stats-api.md](references/customs-company-partner-stats-api.md)
   - Do not guess parameter names, get accurate parameter names and formats from documentation

2. **Data interpretation**:
   - `tradeDates` shows monthly active trading months
   - `hscodes` array shows which HS codes contribute most to trade (with percentage)
   - `products` array shows product-level breakdown with amounts and weights
   - Each product entry includes its associated HS codes

3. **Cross-skill usage**:
   - The company ID can be obtained from **customs-company-stats** or **upkuajing-customs-trade-company-search**
   - HS code distribution data can inform product-focused searches in **upkuajing-customs-trade-company-search**

## Notes
- `companyType` determines the company's role (1=supplier, 2=buyer)
- `percentTrade` is the percentage of trade (as a decimal, e.g., 23.45 means 23.45%)
- `tradeDates` provides a monthly view of when trading activity occurred
- File paths use forward slashes on all platforms
- **Prohibit outputting technical parameter format**: Do not display code-style parameters in responses, convert to natural language
- **Do not** estimate or guess per-call fees — use `python scripts/auth.py --price_info` to get accurate pricing information
- **Do not** guess parameter names, get accurate parameter names and formats from documentation
